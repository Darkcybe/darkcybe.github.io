Incident</span><a href="#event-vs-incident" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2><p>It is important for organizations to understand fundamental terminology and to be able to correctly categorize events, incidents, and efficacy in order to effectively respond to security threats. Establishing clear definitions and methodologies for these concepts can help organizations to better understand and manage potential threats, as well as to develop effective strategies for responding to and mitigating them.</p><p>Here are some basic definitions and examples:</p><ul><li><strong>Events:</strong> Events are any activities or occurrences that are recorded by a system or network. These may include normal system activities, such as logins and file access, as well as unusual or suspicious activities that may indicate a potential threat.<li><strong>Incidents:</strong> Incidents are events that have the potential to compromise the security of an organization’s systems or networks. These may include cyber attacks, malware infections, or other security breaches.<li><strong>Efficacy:</strong> Efficacy refers to the ability of a security measure or control to effectively prevent or mitigate a particular threat. This may be evaluated based on the effectiveness of the measure or control in practice, as well as its cost and any other factors that may impact its use.</ul><h3 id="event-and-incident-categorization"><span class="mr-2">Event and Incident Categorization</span><a href="#event-and-incident-categorization" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p>As a security analyst, it is important to carefully analyze data ingested into a SIEM platform or ticketing system in order to accurately determine the categorization of events and identify potential incidents. This can be a challenging task, as it requires a thorough understanding of security protocols, incident response procedures, and the various types of threats that an organization may face.</p><p>Here are some steps that a security analyst might take when performing analysis of events:</p><ol><li><strong>Review and assess the data:</strong> The first step in analyzing events is to review and assess the data that has been ingested into the SIEM platform or ticketing system. This may involve reviewing logs, network traffic, or other data sources to identify any unusual or suspicious activities.<li><strong>Determine the nature and scope of the event:</strong> Once the data has been reviewed and assessed, the next step is to determine the nature and scope of the event. This may involve identifying the type of event, such as a cyber attack, malware infection, or other security breach, and determining the extent to which the event has impacted the organization’s systems and networks.<li><strong>Assess the risk potential:</strong> After the nature and scope of the event has been determined, the security analyst should assess the risk potential of the event. This may involve evaluating the likelihood that the event will result in harm or damage to the organization, as well as the potential impact if it does occur.<li><strong>Determine the appopriate response:</strong> Once the nature, scope, and risk potential of the event have been determined, the security analyst should determine the appropriate response. This may involve activating the organization’s incident response plan and activating the appropriate response team, depending on the nature and severity of the event.</ol><h2 id="dfir-goals"><span class="mr-2">DFIR Goals</span><a href="#dfir-goals" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2><p>Incident response (IR) and digital forensics are both important tools for addressing and mitigating security threats to an organization’s systems and networks. However, they have different primary goals and focus on different aspects of an incident.</p><p>IR is primarily focused on answering key questions for an organization’s management team, such as who did what to which systems and how to recover as quickly as possible. This typically involves identifying the nature and scope of the incident, containing the threat to prevent further damage, and restoring affected systems and resources to their normal state of operation.</p><p>Digital forensics, on the other hand, is focused on providing verbose evidence that can be used by an organization in any law or insurance proceedings arising from the incident. This may involve conducting a detailed analysis of the incident to identify the root cause, collecting and analyzing forensic evidence, and preparing reports and other documentation.</p><p>During an incident, it is common for both IR and digital forensics to work together in order to achieve the organization’s goals. This allows the incident response team to simplify its objectives into two main categories: responding to the incident and collecting evidence for use in any legal or insurance proceedings. By working together, IR and digital forensics can help organizations to effectively address and mitigate security threats, as well as to protect their interests in the event of any legal or insurance proceedings.</p><h2 id="dfir-responsiblities"><span class="mr-2">DFIR Responsiblities</span><a href="#dfir-responsiblities" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2><p>The key responsibilities of incident response (IR) typically include:</p><ol><li><strong>Identifying and mitigating security threats:</strong> This involves identifying and responding to potential security threats, including cyber attacks, malware infections, and other security breaches.
