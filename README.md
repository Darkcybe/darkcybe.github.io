## About this blog
I work in the Cyber Security industry as a Digital Forensics and Incident Response Analyst. I love my job, namely because Iâ€™m actively interesting in all things relating to cyber security. I created this blog to share information I come across throughout my journey in the aim to help other likeminded people and to act as a central repository for references that I commonly use.

Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions, comments or recommendations!
