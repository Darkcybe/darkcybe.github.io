## Overview

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the worldâ€™s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud platform, offering over 200 fully featured services from data centers globally. [^1]. Certain products can be configured to be publicly accessible queryable via the internet, leaving the door ajar for attacks against the hosted platforms.

Some of the more commonly encountered AWS products are:

- **Compute:** Cloud Infrastructure hosted on AWS (EC2)
- **Containers:** Cloud Containers hosted on AWS (ECS)
- **Storage:** Cloud Storage hosted on AWS (S3)

## AWS-CLI

The AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) is a unified tool to manage your AWS services. With just one tool to download and configure, you can control multiple AWS services from the command line and automate them through scripts. [^2]

The AWS-CLI must first be configured prior to use. If details have not been obtained, arbitrary entries may be used in an attempt of unauthenticated access.

```bash
aws configure

# AWS Access Key ID [None]: accesskey
# AWS Secret Access Key [None]: secretkey
# Default region name [None]: us-west-2
# Default output format [None]:
```

A full list of commands can be found on the [AWS - CLI Command Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/#available-services) page.

## Storage

### Amazon S3

Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is an object storage service offering industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance. Customers of all sizes and industries can store and protect any amount of data for virtually any use case, such as data lakes, cloud-native applications, and mobile apps. With cost-effective storage classes and easy-to-use management features, you can optimize costs, organize data, and configure fine-tuned access controls to meet specific business, organizational, and compliance requirements.
