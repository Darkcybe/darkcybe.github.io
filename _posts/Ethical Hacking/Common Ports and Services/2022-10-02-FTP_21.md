# Overview

The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is a common protocol that is used across all operating systems to aid in remote file transfers between a client and server. FTP is a plaintext protocol, meaning that communication between a client and server are not encrypted. There is a secure version of FTP called SFTP that operates over the SSH port 22.

A number of different FTP application exist that provide added functionality in addition to the native FTP tool, some of those commonly encountered are:
- FileZilla
- CyberDuck
- WinSCP
- FireFTP

Apart from individual application vulnerabilities that can be exploited to gain file or remote access to a host machine, there are a number of actions that can be taken to enumerate objects.

# Reconnaissance

## Port Scanning and Enumeration

Nmap has various scripts that can be run against the different versions, running a generic initial scan and including the `-sC` or `-A` flag will automatically scan with default scripts such as `ftp-syst`, and `ftp-anon`.

| Nmap Script | Description                                            |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| ftp-syst    | Sends FTP SYST and STAT commands, returning the result |
| ftp-anon    | Checks if an FTP server allows anonymous logins.       |

To run all FTP scripts against a target (noisy), the below Nmap command can be used:

```bash
sudo nmap -sC --script ftp-* -p 21 %IP%
```
{: .nolineno }

### Output

The following is the output provided by running a standard scan on target `10.10.10.10`. Note that NSE scripts identify that Anonymous login is allowed (status code 230 - Login Successful), the FTP version is `vsftpd 3.0.3`, and two files were identified being hosted.

```bash
sudo nmap -A 10.10.10.10
...
PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
21/tcp open  ftp     vsftpd 3.0.3
| ftp-anon: Anonymous FTP login allowed (FTP code 230)

|_-rw-r--r--    1 ftp      ftp            62 Apr 20  2021 allowed.userlist.passwd

|_End of status
```
{: .nolineno }

## Connecting to a Remote FTP Server

In some cases, anonymous login to a remote FTP server will be allowed, enabling access to particular files or shared directories without authentication. In such cases, a common list of credentials are:

| Username  | Password  |
|-----------|-----------|
| anonymous |           |
| anonymous | anonymous |
| ftp       | ftp       |

```bash
ftp 10.10.10.10

# List all files, including those hidden
ls -a

# Download a file
mget allowed.userlist
```
