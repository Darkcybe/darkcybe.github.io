## Cybersecurity Risk and Risk Management

Cybersecurity risk refers to the potential for harm to an organization's assets, such as data, systems, and networks, as a result of cyber threats. Cyber threats can include activities such as hacking, malware, phishing, and ransomware attacks, and they can have serious consequences for organizations, such as data breaches, financial losses, and damage to reputation.

Cybersecurity risk is typically measured in terms of the likelihood of a particular threat occurring and the impact it would have on the organization if it did occur. Organizations can take a variety of measures to manage their cybersecurity risks, such as implementing strong passwords, installing antivirus software, and training employees on cybersecurity best practices.

Cybersecurity risk management is the process of identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks to an organization's assets, such as data, systems, and networks. Here are some common areas of cybersecurity risk management:

1. **Risk assessment:** This involves identifying potential risks to the organization's assets and evaluating their likelihood and impact.
2. **Risk treatment:** This involves choosing appropriate measures to mitigate identified risks. These measures can include technical controls, such as firewall and antivirus software, as well as non-technical controls, such as employee training and policies and procedures.
3. **Security controls:** These are measures that are put in place to protect the organization's assets from cyber threats. Examples include firewalls, antivirus software, and intrusion detection and prevention systems.
4. **Incident response:** This involves having a plan in place for responding to cyber incidents, such as data breaches or ransomware attacks. This plan should include steps for containing the incident, analyzing the impact, and restoring affected systems.
5. **Risk communication:** This involves sharing information about cybersecurity risks and incidents with stakeholders, such as employees, customers, and regulators.
6. **Risk governance:** This involves establishing processes and procedures for managing cybersecurity risks within the organization. This can include setting up a risk management committee, establishing policies and procedures, and regularly reviewing and updating risk management processes.

## Cybersecurity Risk Frameworks

A cybersecurity risk framework is a set of guidelines or best practices that organizations can use to manage their cybersecurity risks. There are many different cybersecurity risk frameworks that organizations can choose from, each with a different focus and level of detail. Some common cybersecurity risk frameworks include:

1. NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)
2. ASD Essential Eight
3. CIS Top Critial Controls
4. COBIT 5
5. ISO 2700X Series
6. PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)
7. HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)
8. Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC)
9. SANS Critical Security Controls
10. NIST SP 800-53

These are just a few examples, and there are many other cybersecurity risk frameworks that organizations can use. The best framework for a particular organization will depend on its specific needs and goals, as well as its industry and regulatory requirements.

Below is are some of the more mature frameworks that can assist in developing robust protections of an organizations network:

1. [NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework) - Developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), this framework provides guidance for organizations to manage their cybersecurity risks. It consists of five core functions: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover.
2. [ASD Essential Eight](https://www.cyber.gov.au/acsc/view-all-content/publications/essential-eight-maturity-model) - Developed by the Australian Signals Directorate (ASD), this framework consists of eight critical mitigations that organizations can implement to reduce their cybersecurity risks. The eight mitigations are: application whitelisting, patching applications, patching operating systems, restricting administrative privileges, application sandboxing, disabling unnecessary services, enabling multifactor authentication, and using virtual private networks (VPNs).
3. [CIS Top Critical Controls](https://www.cisecurity.org/controls/cis-controls-list) - developed by the Center for Internet Security (CIS), this framework consists of 20 critical controls that organizations can implement to reduce their cybersecurity risks. The controls are divided into two categories: basic and advanced.
4. [COBIT 5](https://www.isaca.org/resources/cobit) - Developed by the Information Systems Audit and Control Association (ISACA), this framework provides guidance for the governance and management of information and technology. It consists of five principles: meeting stakeholder needs, covering the enterprise end-to-end, applying a single integrated framework, enabling a holistic approach, and separating governance from management.
5. [ISO 27001](http://www.27000.org/) - Developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), this standard provides guidance for the establishment, implementation, maintenance, and improvement of an information security management system (ISMS). It consists of 14 clauses that cover different aspects of information security, including risk assessment and treatment, asset management, and incident management.
6. [ISO 27002](http://www.27000.org/) - Developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), this standard provides guidelines for the implementation of an information security management system (ISMS). It covers a wide range of information security topics, including risk assessment and treatment, asset management, and incident management.
