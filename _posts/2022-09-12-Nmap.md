“Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a free and open source utility for network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what hosts are available on the network, what services (application name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems (and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X.” - [nmap.org](https://nmap.org/)

It is perhaps the most utilized tool when initiating a pentest or challenge for a CTF event and is also used for system administration purposes to map network devices. Nmap can be found on popular pentesting environments natively such as Kali Linux and ParrotOS.

# Instructions
## Performing Scans
Nmap scans networked devices based on 9 scan phases, that include; Target Enumeration, Host Discovery, Reverse-DNS Resolution, OS Detection, Version Detection, Port Scanning, Traceroute, Script Scanning (using the Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE)) and finally, output. Command switches are used to modify those phases for more simplified and passive, or complex and aggressive scanning. Some basic scans that are useful for system discovery are as below:
```bash
# Scan a host for a single port
nmap -p22 <IP ADDRESS>

# Scan a subnet for active hosts via ping scan and output to a file
nmap -sn -oA <output Name/Directory> <IP ADDRESS>/CIDR

# Scan a host, enabling OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute with verbose output
nmap -v -A -sV <IP ADDRESS> or <DOMAIN>
```
{: .nolineno }

## Performing Complex Scans
As mentioned above, Nmap has the ability to conduct complex and aggressive scanning which can be very useful for internal security teams and penetration testers alike. Some handy scans are as below:
```bash
# Scan a host across ports 1-1023 and ports that are mapped to services, enabling OS detection, version detection, script scanning (default scripts), and traceroute with formatted output
nmap -sC -sV -p1-1023,[1024-] <IP ADDRESS> or <DOMAIN>

# Scan a host with aggressive detection, in fast mode, and across all ports
nmap -A -T4 -p- <IP ADDRESS>

# Scan a host and return vulnerablity listings using NSE
nmap -sV --script=vulners <IP ADDRESS>

# Scan a webserver and retrieve banner information via NSE
nmap -sV --script=http-enum <IP ADDRESS>
```
{: .nolineno }

> There are over 600 pre-packaged scripts and many more available through third-party repositories. By Default on Linux installs, scripts are kept in the directory `/usr/share/nmap/scripts`. 
{: .prompt-info }

## Searching the NSE Database

There are numerous pre-packaged scripts that ship default with Nmap, with additional extensions or specialized scripts able to be created or downloaded via repositories such as GitHub. The following are a few more precise commands that can be used to interact with the script database

```bash
# Searching the NSE Database
nmap --script-help "smb-*" | grep "^smb-"

# Displaying Script Help
nmap --script-help "smb-os-discovery"
```
{: .nolineno }

# Additional Info
## ZenMap

Nmap provides a GUI frontend for the application called ZenMap. Commands are still entered as previous examples display, however the GUI interface can display network topology information in a graphical view.

```
1. From the example above are several open ports, with Nmap attributing Service and Version details based on header details returnd by the target host. This information can provide valuable insight into the hosts role, potential vulnerabilities, targets for further enumeration consequently and attack entry points.
2. Based on the above port details, we can ascertain the the server 10.20.30.40 is a Domain Controller, with ports relating to Kerberos and LDAP being observed. The trailing section details Nmap script execution details that identify that SMB version 3.1.1 is in use on the host.
