## DFIR Overview

Digital forensics is the process of examining and analyzing digital devices, such as computers, smartphones, and servers, in order to gather and preserve evidence that can be used in a court of law. It involves the use of specialized tools and techniques to extract, analyze, and present digital evidence in a way that is reliable and admissible in legal proceedings.

Incident response is the process of identifying, responding to, and managing the aftermath of a security incident or breach. It involves a set of coordinated activities designed to minimize the impact of the incident and restore affected systems and resources to their normal state of operation.

In many cases, digital forensics and incident response overlap, as both involve the collection and analysis of digital evidence in order to understand and respond to a security incident. Digital forensics is typically used to investigate the root cause of an incident and to gather evidence that can be used in legal proceedings, while incident response focuses on minimizing the impact of the incident and restoring affected systems and resources.

## DFIR Frameworks

There are several common incident response frameworks that organizations can use to guide their response to security incidents. These frameworks provide a structured approach to incident response and can help organizations to better understand and manage the various stages of an incident.

1. [SANS PICERL](https://www.cynet.com/incident-response/incident-response-sans-the-6-steps-in-depth/): SANS PICERL is a framework developed by the SANS Institute that describes the seven stages of incident response: preparation, identification, containment, eradication, recovery, lessons learned, and post-incident activity. The goal of SANS PICERL is to help organizations to quickly and effectively respond to and recover from security incidents.
2. [NIST SP800-61r2: Computer Security Incident Handling Guide](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-61r2.pdf): NIST SP 800-61r2 is a framework developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) that describes the process of responding to computer security incidents. It covers the entire incident response lifecycle, from preparing for incidents to post-incident activity.
3. [RE&CT framework](https://atc-project.github.io/atc-react/): The RE&CT (Response, Engage, Analyze, Contain, Terminate) framework is a framework for incident response that is designed to build on top of the NIST framework and the MITRE ATT&CK framework. It provides a detailed and actionable template for incident response techniques, covering the entire incident response lifecycle.

These incident response frameworks provide a structured approach to responding to security incidents and can help organizations to better understand and manage the various stages of an incident. They provide guidance on preparing for incidents, detecting and analyzing threats, containing and eradicating incidents, and recovering from incidents. Below are the breakdowns of the individual stages of each framework.

SANS PICERL consists of the following seven stages:

1. **Preparation:** This phase involves planning and preparing for incident response, including developing response plans, training staff, and testing systems.
2. **Identification:** This phase involves identifying the nature and extent of the incident, including identifying indicators of compromise, analyzing logs and network traffic, and determining the scope and impact of the incident.
3. **Containment:** This phase involves containing the incident to prevent further damage, including isolating affected systems, blocking access to certain resources, and implementing other containment measures.
4. **Eradication:** This phase involves removing the threat from the organization's systems and restoring any damaged or compromised resources.
5. **Recovery:** This phase involves restoring affected systems and resources to their normal state of operation.
6. **Lessons learned:** This phase involves reviewing and improving incident response plans and procedures based on the lessons learned from the incident.
7. **Post-incident activity:** This phase involves conducting post-incident activities, such as reporting and communicating about the incident and conducting forensic analysis to understand the root cause of the incident.

NIST SP 800-61r2 covers the following stages:

1. **Preparation:** This phase involves planning and preparing for incident response, including developing response plans, training staff, and testing systems.
2. **Detection:** This phase involves detecting and identifying indicators of compromise and determining the scope and impact of the incident.
3. **Analysis:** This phase involves analyzing the nature and extent of the incident, including analyzing logs and network traffic and identifying the root cause of the incident.
4. **Containment:** This phase involves containing the incident to prevent further damage, including isolating affected systems, blocking access to certain resources, and implementing other containment measures.
5. **Eradication:** This phase involves removing the threat from the organization's systems and restoring any damaged or compromised resources.
6. **Recovery:** This phase involves restoring affected systems and resources to their normal state of operation.
7. **Post-incident activity:** This phase involves conducting post-incident activities, such as reporting and communicating about the incident, conducting forensic analysis to understand the root cause of the incident, and reviewing and improving incident response plans and procedures.

The RE&CT framework consists of the following five stages:

1. **Respond:** This phase involves activating the organization's incident response plan and activating the appropriate response team. It may also involve identifying the nature and scope of the incident, as well as assessing the risk potential.
2. **Engage:** This phase involves gathering additional information about the incident, including analyzing logs and network traffic and identifying indicators of compromise. It may also involve engaging with other stakeholders, such as law enforcement or external cybersecurity experts.
3. **Analyze:** This phase involves conducting a detailed analysis of the incident, including identifying the root cause of the incident and any vulnerabilities that were exploited by the attacker.
4. **Contain:** This phase involves containing the incident to prevent further damage, including isolating affected systems, blocking access to certain resources, and implementing other containment measures.
5. **Terminate:** This phase involves removing the threat from the organization's systems and restoring any damaged or compromised resources. It may also involve conducting post-incident activities, such as reporting and communicating about the incident, conducting forensic analysis, and reviewing and improving incident response plans and procedures.

### Adversarial Frameworks

Adversarial frameworks are frameworks that describe the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by attackers to compromise systems and networks. These frameworks can be used to understand the methods and tactics used by adversaries, as well as to identify and defend against potential threats.

Some common adversarial frameworks include:

1. [MITRE ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/): The MITRE ATT&CK framework is a comprehensive knowledge base of adversarial TTPs, organized by tactics and techniques. It covers the entire attack lifecycle, from initial reconnaissance to post-compromise actions, and is designed to help organizations understand and defend against potential threats.
2. [Cyber Kill Chain](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/capabilities/cyber/cyber-kill-chain.html): The Cyber Kill Chain is a framework developed by Lockheed Martin that describes the seven stages of a cyber attack, from initial reconnaissance to exfiltration of data. It is designed to help organizations to identify and mitigate potential threats at each stage of the attack.
3. [D3fend Framework](https://d3fend.mitre.org/): The D3fend Framework is a framework developed by the Center for Internet Security (CIS) that describes the five stages of incident response: prepare, detect, defend, respond, and recover. It is designed to help organizations to plan and prepare for incident response and to quickly and effectively respond to and recover from incidents.
4. [CAPEC (Common Attack Pattern Enumeration and Classification)](https://capec.mitre.org/): The CAPEC framework is a comprehensive knowledge base of common attack patterns that can be used to compromise systems and networks. It is developed and maintained by the MITRE Corporation and is designed to help organizations understand and defend against potential threats.

Adversarial frameworks like the aforementioned examples can be useful tools for understanding the methods and tactics used by adversaries and for identifying and defending against potential threats. By providing a detailed understanding of adversarial TTPs, these frameworks can help organizations to better protect their systems and networks from potential attacks.

## Event Vs. Incident

It is important for organizations to understand fundamental terminology and to be able to correctly categorize events, incidents, and efficacy in order to effectively respond to security threats. Establishing clear definitions and methodologies for these concepts can help organizations to better understand and manage potential threats, as well as to develop effective strategies for responding to and mitigating them.

Here are some basic definitions and examples:

- **Events:** Events are any activities or occurrences that are recorded by a system or network. These may include normal system activities, such as logins and file access, as well as unusual or suspicious activities that may indicate a potential threat.
- **Incidents:** Incidents are events that have the potential to compromise the security of an organization's systems or networks. These may include cyber attacks, malware infections, or other security breaches.
- **Efficacy:** Efficacy refers to the ability of a security measure or control to effectively prevent or mitigate a particular threat. This may be evaluated based on the effectiveness of the measure or control in practice, as well as its cost and any other factors that may impact its use.

### Event and Incident Categorization

As a security analyst, it is important to carefully analyze data ingested into a SIEM platform or ticketing system in order to accurately determine the categorization of events and identify potential incidents. This can be a challenging task, as it requires a thorough understanding of security protocols, incident response procedures, and the various types of threats that an organization may face.

Here are some steps that a security analyst might take when performing analysis of events:

1. **Review and assess the data:** The first step in analyzing events is to review and assess the data that has been ingested into the SIEM platform or ticketing system. This may involve reviewing logs, network traffic, or other data sources to identify any unusual or suspicious activities.
2. **Determine the nature and scope of the event:** Once the data has been reviewed and assessed, the next step is to determine the nature and scope of the event. This may involve identifying the type of event, such as a cyber attack, malware infection, or other security breach, and determining the extent to which the event has impacted the organization's systems and networks.
3. **Assess the risk potential:** After the nature and scope of the event has been determined, the security analyst should assess the risk potential of the event. This may involve evaluating the likelihood that the event will result in harm or damage to the organization, as well as the potential impact if it does occur.
4. **Determine the appopriate response:** Once the nature, scope, and risk potential of the event have been determined, the security analyst should determine the appropriate response. This may involve activating the organization's incident response plan and activating the appropriate response team, depending on the nature and severity of the event.

## DFIR Goals

Incident response (IR) and digital forensics are both important tools for addressing and mitigating security threats to an organization's systems and networks. However, they have different primary goals and focus on different aspects of an incident.

IR is primarily focused on answering key questions for an organization's management team, such as who did what to which systems and how to recover as quickly as possible. This typically involves identifying the nature and scope of the incident, containing the threat to prevent further damage, and restoring affected systems and resources to their normal state of operation.

Digital forensics, on the other hand, is focused on providing verbose evidence that can be used by an organization in any law or insurance proceedings arising from the incident. This may involve conducting a detailed analysis of the incident to identify the root cause, collecting and analyzing forensic evidence, and preparing reports and other documentation.

During an incident, it is common for both IR and digital forensics to work together in order to achieve the organization's goals. This allows the incident response team to simplify its objectives into two main categories: responding to the incident and collecting evidence for use in any legal or insurance proceedings. By working together, IR and digital forensics can help organizations to effectively address and mitigate security threats, as well as to protect their interests in the event of any legal or insurance proceedings.

## DFIR Responsiblities

The key responsibilities of incident response (IR) typically include:

1. **Identifying and mitigating security threats:** This involves identifying and responding to potential security threats, including cyber attacks, malware infections, and other security breaches. It may involve analyzing logs, network traffic, and other data sources to identify indicators of compromise, as well as implementing containment measures to prevent further damage.
2. **Restoring affected systems and resources:** After a threat has been identified and contained, IR may be responsible for restoring affected systems and resources to their normal state of operation. This may involve repairing or rebuilding systems, restoring data from backups, and implementing other recovery measures.
4. **Communicating with stakeholders:** IR may be responsible for communicating with stakeholders, such as management, employees, customers, and law enforcement, about the incident and any necessary actions that need to be taken.
5. **Reviewing and improving incident response plans:** After an incident has been resolved, IR may be responsible for reviewing and improving the organization's incident response plans and procedures based on the lessons learned from the incident. This may involve identifying any weaknesses or vulnerabilities that were exploited by the attacker, as well as implementing new controls or procedures to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.

The key responsibilities of digital forensics professionals typically include:

1. **Collecting and preserving digital evidence:** Digital forensics professionals are responsible for collecting and preserving digital evidence in a manner that is forensically sound and admissible in a court of law.
